Hi, i created these ready to use scripts for unity3d. what you need to do is attached only the PlayerInteraction.cs to player, and create a new layer in the inspector called "Interactable" for every object in the scene you want the player to interect with.
hope i can help you in some way to speed the process of making your game. the library will be update with new scripts.
if you want to donate that will be awesome it will help me continue this project, thanks!
